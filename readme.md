### Prerequisites

Web Browser: You will need a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge to run and test the web application.

Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You will need a text editor or IDE to write and edit the code for the project. Popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or JetBrains WebStorm.

Node.js: If the project involves server-side development using Node.js, you will need to install Node.js runtime on your machine. Node.js allows you to run JavaScript code on the server. You can download the Node.js installer from the official Node.js website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Package Manager: Depending on the project setup, you may need a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn to manage project dependencies and install external libraries or frameworks. npm is included with Node.js, so it will be installed automatically when you install Node.js. Yarn can be installed separately by following the instructions on the Yarn website.

Server-side Frameworks and Libraries: If the project requires a server-side framework like Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, or any other framework, you will need to install the framework and any associated dependencies. This can typically be done using the package manager (e.g., npm install express) or by following the framework's documentation.


### Installing

you need the following:
npm install ----> to install all the required dependencies
notice: you may still need to download the nodeomon as a dependency

make your env file with new names and add them to the server with the new names
for example USERNAME1 = //     instead of USERNAME and make sure you do that too when you add the name to the server file.

to get the keys like username and weatherbit key you need to create them yourself and add them with different names
to the env file and still make the changes based on that


## ðŸ”§ Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

npm run test will run jest in the terminal and get you the results
you are free to make more jest testing on your version of the project.


## ðŸš€ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

npm run build to get the live version of a new build after you have installed the packages and setup new environment keys and added them to the server functions in a proper way.
